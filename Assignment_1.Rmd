#### Task 1: Assign the value of five to a variable called a and the value of two to a variable called b.
a <- 5
b <- 2

#### Task 2: Compute the sum, difference, product and ratio of a and b (a always in the first place) and store the results to four different variables called r1, r2, r3, and r4.

##### Sum of a and b stored to r1
r1 <- a+b

##### Difference of a and b stored to r2
r2 <- a-b

##### Product of a and b stored to r3
r3 <- a*b

##### Ratio of a and b stored to r4
r4 <- a/b

#### Task 3: Create a vector v1 which contains the values stored within the four variables from step 2.
v1 <- c(r1,r2,r3,r4)

#### Task 4: Add a fifth entry to vector v1 which represents a by the power of b (i.e. a**b).
r5 <- a**b
v1 <- c(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5)

## Task 5: Show the content of vector v1 (e.g. use the print function or just type the variable name in a separate row).
print(v1)

#### Task 6: Create a second vector v2 which contains information on the type of mathematical operation used to derive the five results. Hence this vector should have five entries of values sum, difference,â€¦
v2 <- c("sum","difference","product","ratio","power")

#### Task 7: Show the content of vector v2.
print(v2)

#### Task 8: Combine the two vectors v1 and v2 into a data frame called df. Each vector should become one column of the data frame so you will end up with a data frame having 5 rows and 2 columns.
df <- data.frame(v1 = v1, v2 = v2)

#### Task 9: Make sure that the column with the data of v1 is named Results and v2 is named Operation.
df <- data.frame(Results = v1, Operation = v2)

#### Task 10: Show the entire content of df.
print(df)

#### Task 11: Show just the entry of the cell in the second row and first column.
df[2,1]
